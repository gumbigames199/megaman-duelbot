// (Deprecated)
// The /settings slash commands (view/set) have been removed per requirements.
// This module intentionally exports no slash commands.
//
// If you later want to reintroduce specific, limited settings,
// create a new command file (e.g., settings_min.ts) and register it in index.ts.
